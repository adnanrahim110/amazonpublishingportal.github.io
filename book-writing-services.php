                            <div class=accordion-body> If you want to improve your writing style, you will have to
                                dedicate some time to practice. To get an idea of what writing style you should employ,
                                do some reading from the specific genre your book will be. Once you get an idea, try to
                                mimic the same style and match the tone. Or you could hire a ghost writer. </div>

                            <div class=accordion-body> Fiction writing is painting a picture that is incredibly creative
                                while describing a story that is fabricated. On the other hand, nonfiction writing is
                                all about the facts and needs to be based on true events. As a result, it has to be
                                straightforward. </div>

                            <div class=accordion-body> There is no fixed length for a book's chapter. The book is
                                divided into chapters to improve readability and to separate each part of the story. So,
                                focus on ensuring your chapters align with the story and flow well. It's normal for some
                                chapters to be short while others are lengthier. </div>
