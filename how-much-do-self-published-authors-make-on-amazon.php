          <h3>1.  Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) for eBooks</h3>
          <p class="pb-4 m-0">
              <a href="amazon-publishing-service">Kindle Direct Publishing</a> (KDP) is Amazon’s platform that helps people self publish their eBooks. So, individuals can easily format their eBook with the help of Kindle Create, Amazon’s tool. If your book is already formatted, you can upload the manuscript in formats such as ePub or MOBI.<br><br>
            When using KDP, you have complete control, especially when it comes to setting the price for your eBook. Generally, you can take your pick from two options in terms of royalty—35% royalty and 70% royalty. However, keep in mind that if you choose the 70% royalty option, a certain criterion needs to be met.<br><br>
            Once published, your eBook will easily be available on the platform’s Kindle Store. As a result, millions of individuals from across the globe can access and purchase it. For enrolling your eBook so that readers can borrow and read your book as per their subscription, you have two choices— Kindle Unlimited and the Kindle Owners' Lending Library.
        </p>
        
          <h3>2.  Kindle Direct Publishing Print (KDP Print) for Paperbacks</h3>
              Kindle Direct Publishing Print (KDP Print) is intended for paperbacks and provides individuals with guidelines and templates that allow them to format paperback manuscripts. You also have the choice to upload a print-ready PDF. <a href="amazon-publishing-service">Kindle Direct Publishing</a> Print employs print-on-demand technology, which implies that the paperback book will be printed only when someone orders a copy of the book.<br><br>
The best part of Amazon is that the platform will deal with printing, customer service, and shipping. Just like with KDP for eBooks, you can set the price for your paperback, but the platform will subtract the printing costs and royalties from the list price.<br><br>
As for royalty options, you can choose from 35% or 60% royalty. KDP Print further makes distribution simple for individuals by providing extended distribution, which makes your paperback accessible to online retailers, bookstores, libraries, etc.<br><br>
At the end of the day, both KDP and KDP Print will offer you several tools and resources that can effectively assist authors and others in monitoring their sales and keeping track of royalties while making required adjustments to your book.<br><br>
One thing to be cautious about is that Amazon offers several platforms for self-publishing. However, if you want to ensure the best outcome for your book, you will need to invest in professional services that handle editing, <a href="book-cover-designing">cover designs</a>, formatting, marketing, etc.
         <h2>How Much Does <span>It Cost to Self Publish a Book</span> on Amazon?</h2>
              Are you wondering how much does it cost to publish a book on Amazon? Well, since you have already gotten familiar with the choices Amazon offers for interested individuals, you’re likely to have a rough idea.<br><br>

As discussed, Amazon provides two opportunities, <a href="https://amazonpublishingportal.com/">Kindle Direct Publishing</a> and Kindle Direct Publishing Print, for individuals who desire to publish their books on their own.<br><br>
With KDP, you can publish your eBooks for free, so you just have to settle on a price and then earn royalties for every sale your book makes. Meanwhile, with KDP Print, you can benefit from the fact that no upfront costs are required, but the printing and shipping costs will be included.<br><br>
Having said that, added services, such as <a href="book-editing-proofreading-service">professional editing, proofreading</a>, cover design, marketing, etc., can boost the cost to self publish on Amazon.

         <h2>Factors to Consider for <span>Amazon Publishing</span> Services Cost</h2>
         <p class="pb-4 m-0">
             When you’re managing costs for selling self published books on Amazon, there are a bunch of factors that come into play. They are as follows:
         </p>
              <li><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i>Ebook Pricing </li>
              <li><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i>Paperback Pricing </li>
              <li><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i>Royalty Rates</li>
              <li><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i>Printing and Distribution Costs</li>
            <p class="pb-4 m-0">Let’s discuss them. </p>
            <h3>1.  Ebook Pricing </h3>
            <p class="pb-4 m-0">Amazon allows total control over the eBook pricing, which in turn impacts the royalties that are earned. As discussed, individuals can either choose 35% or 70%, but the latter has some specifications, such as setting the list price within a certain range.</p>
            <h3>2.  Paperback Pricing</h3>
            <p class="pb-4 m-0">
                The paperback pricing also impacts the overall costs of <a href="self-publishing-service">self publishing on Amazon</a> as interested individuals decide the list price, and then the platform will make deductions based on the printing and royalties.
The printing cost depends on several factors, such as the total number of pages of the book, ink type, trim size, etc.
            <h3>3. Royalty Rates</h3>
                The royalty rate that you opt for will impact the amount you earn for every sale. A higher royalty rate has a couple of requirements that you need to keep in mind when self publishing your book. These requirements include pricing criteria or distribution limitations.
            <h3>4. Printing and Distribution Costs</h3>
                When using Kindle Direct Publishing Print, your books will be printed when someone places an order. Put simply, KDP Print utilizes print-on-demand technology. So, the printing costs will be subtracted from the list price, including the royalties. Distribution costs may also add to the expenses if you decide to go for an expanded distribution of paperbacks.
